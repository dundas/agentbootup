# Code Review Workflow

Orchestrate the complete code review process: fetch PR feedback, analyze gaps, and iterate on fixes until merge-ready.

## Usage

```
/code-review-workflow [PR_NUMBER]
```

Or simply:
```
/code-review-workflow
```
(Will prompt for PR number)

## What This Does

1. **Fetches PR Review Comments**
   - Retrieves all review feedback from GitHub
   - Categorizes by severity (blocking, suggestions, questions)
   - Identifies resolved vs. unresolved items

2. **Analyzes Code Gaps**
   - Compares current code against review feedback
   - Generates prioritized action items
   - Calculates merge readiness score
   - Creates detailed gap analysis report

3. **Iterates on Fixes** (with your approval)
   - Implements highest priority fixes
   - Validates with tests and linters
   - Commits working changes
   - Repeats until merge-ready or max iterations

4. **Reports Final Status**
   - Shows what was fixed
   - Highlights remaining work
   - Provides merge recommendation

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Fetch PR Review
Uses `fetch-pr-review` skill to:
- Connect to GitHub via `gh` CLI
- Retrieve all review comments
- Categorize by severity
- Save to `tasks/code-review-[pr]-feedback.json`

### Step 2: Analyze Gaps
Uses `analyze-code-gaps` skill to:
- Map comments to current code
- Identify unresolved issues
- Calculate merge readiness score
- Generate prioritized action plan
- Save to `tasks/code-review-[pr]-gaps.md`

### Step 3: Iterate on Fixes
Uses `iterate-on-feedback` skill to:
- Implement fixes one at a time
- Validate with tests/linters
- Commit successful changes
- Update progress tracking
- Repeat until done or max iterations (5)

### Step 4: Report Results
- Show final merge readiness score
- List resolved vs. remaining issues
- Provide merge recommendation
- Save iteration log

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Tests configured and runnable
- Linter/formatter configured (optional but recommended)

## Configuration

Create `.code-review-config.json` in project root (optional):
```json
{
  "max_iterations": 5,
  "auto_commit": true,
  "run_tests": true,
  "run_linter": true,
  "merge_readiness_threshold": 80,
  "stopping_criteria": {
    "all_blockers_resolved": true,
    "tests_passing": true,
    "no_new_issues": true
  }
}
```

## Output Files

All files saved to `tasks/` directory:

- `code-review-[pr]-feedback.json` - Raw PR review data
- `code-review-[pr]-gaps.md` - Gap analysis report
- `code-review-[pr]-state.json` - Workflow state tracking
- `code-review-[pr]-iterations.md` - Iteration log

## Tips

**For Quick Reviews**:
```
/code-review-workflow 123 --quick
```
Skips detailed analysis, focuses on blockers only

**For Dry Run**:
```
/code-review-workflow 123 --dry-run
```
Shows what would be fixed without making changes

**For Specific Gaps**:
```
/code-review-workflow 123 --gaps Gap-1,Gap-3
```
Only addresses specified gaps

## Troubleshooting

**"GitHub CLI not found"**
```bash
# Install gh CLI
brew install gh  # macOS
# or visit: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

**"PR not found"**
- Verify PR number is correct
- Check you're in the right repository
- Ensure PR exists and is accessible

**"Tests failing"**
- Review test output in iteration log
- May need to fix tests separately
- Use `--skip-tests` flag if needed (not recommended)

**"Max iterations reached"**
- Some issues may require human intervention
- Review iteration log to see what was attempted
- May need architectural changes
