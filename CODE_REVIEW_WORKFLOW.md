# Code Review Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete AI-powered code review workflow system based on research into Claude Code's approach and agentic AI design patterns. The system automates the process of analyzing PR review feedback, identifying gaps, and iteratively fixing issues until code is merge-ready.

## Architecture

### Design Pattern: **Reflection + Planning**

The workflow uses a dual-loop architecture combining:
- **Planning-focused**: Structured gap analysis and prioritization
- **Reflection-focused**: Iterative fix-validate-reflect loops with learning

- Categorizes by severity (blocking, suggestions, questions)
- Identifies resolved vs. unresolved items
- Outputs structured JSON

**`analyze-code-gaps/`**
- Maps comments to current code
- Identifies what's been addressed

- Supports flags: `--dry-run`, `--quick`, `--gaps`

### 4. Windsurf Workflow
**`code-review-workflow.md`**
- Entry point for Windsurf/Cascade users
- Same functionality as command
- Integrated with Windsurf slash commands

### 5. Documentation
**`ai-dev-tasks/code-review-guide.md`**
- Complete user guide
- Example sessions
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices
- Configuration options

## Key Features

### Reflection Loop Pattern
```
For iteration 1 to MAX_ITERATIONS:
  1. SELECT: Choose highest priority gap
  2. IMPLEMENT: Apply the fix
  3. VALIDATE: Run tests and checks
  4. REFLECT: Analyze results
  5. CHECK: Evaluate stopping criteria
  6. REPORT: Update progress
```

### Stopping Criteria
- **Success**: All blockers resolved + tests passing
- **Max Iterations**: Reached 5 iterations
- **Stuck**: No progress in 2 iterations
- **User Halt**: User requests stop

### Merge Readiness Score
```javascript
Score = 100 - (blocking × 20) - (suggestions × 5) - (test_failures × 15)
// Capped at 0-100
```

### Categorization System
- **Blocking**: Must fix (keywords: must, required, critical, security, bug)
- **Suggestions**: Nice-to-have (keywords: consider, could, nit, optional)
- **Questions**: Need clarification (contains: ?, why, how)
- **Resolved**: Already addressed (thread resolved, reply contains: fixed, done)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# In Claude Code
/code-review-workflow 123

# In Windsurf
/code-review-workflow
# Then enter PR number when prompted
```

### Your Typical Prompt
```
Let's check the code review on PR #123 and create a gap analysis 
of our current code and the final state of "ready to merge"
```

This now triggers the complete workflow automatically.

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Dry run (no changes)
/code-review-workflow 123 --dry-run

# Quick mode (blockers only)
/code-review-workflow 123 --quick

# Specific gaps only
/code-review-workflow 123 --gaps Gap-1,Gap-3
```

## Output Files

All saved to `tasks/` directory:

1. **`code-review-[pr]-feedback.json`**
   - Raw PR review data
   - Categorized comments
   - CI/CD status

2. **`code-review-[pr]-gaps.md`**
   - Detailed gap analysis
   - Code snippets
   - Recommended fixes
   - Priority scores

3. **`code-review-[pr]-state.json`**
   - Workflow state tracking
   - Iteration history
   - Progress metrics

4. **`code-review-[pr]-iterations.md`**
   - Iteration log
   - What was attempted
   - Validation results
   - Commits made

## Integration Points

### GitHub CLI
- Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Uses `gh pr view` for fetching reviews
- Uses `gh pr checks` for CI status

### Testing
- Runs `npm test` (configurable)
- Validates after each fix
- Requires tests to pass before commit

### Version Control
- Commits after each successful iteration
- Uses conventional commit format
- Includes detailed multi-line messages
- References PR and iteration number

## Design Decisions

### Why Reflection Pattern?
- Allows learning from validation failures
- Enables iterative improvement
- Prevents infinite loops with max iterations
- Provides clear stopping criteria

### Why Multi-Agent?
- Separation of concerns (fetch, analyze, iterate)
- Reusable skills for other workflows
- Easier to test and maintain
- Follows single responsibility principle

### Why Human-in-the-Loop?
- Requires approval before each fix
- Prevents runaway automation
- Allows user to stop/redirect
- Builds trust through transparency

### Why Max 5 Iterations?
- Prevents infinite loops
- Forces escalation for complex issues
- Most reviews addressable in 3-5 fixes
- Balances automation with human judgment

## Comparison to Claude Code's Approach

### Similarities
- Dual-loop architecture (inner dev loop + outer automation)
- Slash commands for on-demand execution
- GitHub Actions integration capability
- Security-focused with OWASP patterns
- Reflection-based iteration

### Differences
- Our implementation is more generic (not just security)
- We provide gap analysis with scoring
- We track merge readiness explicitly
- We support multiple AI providers (not just Claude)
- We include comprehensive documentation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **GitHub Actions integration** - Auto-run on PR open
2. **Multi-reviewer support** - Aggregate feedback from multiple reviewers
3. **Learning from history** - Track common issues across PRs
4. **Custom rules engine** - Project-specific review criteria
5. **Diff-aware analysis** - Only analyze changed lines
6. **Performance benchmarks** - Track fix time and success rate
7. **Team analytics** - Review patterns and bottlenecks

### Configuration Options
Already supported via `.code-review-config.json`:
- Max iterations
- Auto-commit behavior
- Test/lint commands
- Merge readiness threshold
- Custom stopping criteria

## Installation

```bash
# From agentbootup repo
node bootup.mjs --target /path/to/your/project

# Or install specific category
node bootup.mjs --target . --subset agents,skills,commands
```

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub CLI**: `brew install gh && gh auth login`
2. **Tests configured**: Runnable via `npm test` or equivalent
3. **Git repository**: With remote PR capability

## Testing the Workflow

1. **Create a test PR** with some review comments
2. **Run the workflow**: `/code-review-workflow [PR_NUMBER]`
3. **Verify outputs**: Check `tasks/` directory for generated files
4. **Review commits**: Ensure conventional commit format
